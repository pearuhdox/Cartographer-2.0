# Cartographer v2
Cartographer (version 2.0) is a collection of datapacks for Minecraft 1.21 and onward that add custom enchantments, statuses, mob attacks, and more. These mechanics are primarily designed around CTM (Complete the Monument) maps, but can be used for a variety of projects.

Each folder above is a separate datapack which can be dropped into a Minecraft world's "datapack" folder. Once placed inside the datapack folder, and the world has been reloaded, they will add new features to the game.

## Libraries

Cartographer uses a couple different libraries produced by myself and other talented individuals. For your convenience, the Cartographer download includes these libraries for you, with permission from creators and links to their original project pages (when they exist). You are free to use the versions of these libraries provided as is from the other creators directly. Cartographer makes no functional changes to any of these packs.

**Black Box Library** by RockNRed and PearUhDox (https://github.com/RockNRui/Black-Box-Library) - A variety of useful datapack utilities.

**Entity ID and Hit Detection System (aka ehid)** by gibbsly (https://github.com/gibbsly/ehid) - Detects when entities and players hit each other.

**Loot Table Output Specificity (aka ltos)** by gibbsly (https://github.com/gibbsly/ltos) - Detects when blocks are broken and entities are killed, and where.

**Display Item Entity System** by RockNRed, PearUhDox, and gibbsly (https://github.com/RockNRui/Display-Item-Entity-System) - A datapack that allows for placing items in world and giving them interaction hitboxes to be picked up with.

**Player Motion** by Mulv (and the Minecraft Commands Discord) originally by BigPapi - (https://github.com/MulverineX/player_motion) A library datapack that allows for giving a player specified precise motion.

**Mob Motion** by Suso, CooleyBrekka, and PearUhDox - A library datapack that allows for giving entities specified precise motion.

Cartographer also features a datapack called "Core" which schedules and runs all other Datapacks in the collection. Core is the only library which cannot be found outside of Cartographer.

## Modules

These are the currently available Cartographer modules for 1.21.

**Charon** - Adds various alternatives to the standard death system in Minecraft.

**Custom Statuses** - Additional status effects which can be applied to mobs and players, both beneficial and negative. Also adds an item api for applying those effects to mobs from items.

**Repair Stations** - Adds a structure which can be spawned in world which serves as an alternative to anvils. It can repair gear with increasing and controllable costs, and protects gear lost from durability destroying it.
